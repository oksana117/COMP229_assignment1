  <p "text-muted">Hi there! My name is Oksana Koshulap. I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree in the spring of 2020 with a 
  major in Biomedical Sciences and a minor in Philosophy from Ryerson University.
   Currently, I'm studying Software Engineering at Centennial College. 
   I really enjoy both worlds of software development and biomedicine and would love to pursue those in the future. 
   One of my hobbies is painting. Click here to view my Resume. </p>
